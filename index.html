            <p>WOO HOO! Welcome to my very first blog post!</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Yes, I have been saying for <em>years</em> that I will start a blog.  Well now that I am sharpening my skillset in web development I really have no excuse <strong>not to</strong>. To start off with, I fully expect this site to change, and grow with what I am learning and doing.  As of right now I am using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> as a tool to create this blog, and in particular I am using their <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/examples/blog/">example blog</a> as a template.  Right this very second this blog is going to look a whole lot like the example.  This will be a <em>temporary</em> state as I continue to add and develop ideas for what I want this site to be. </p>
            <h2>Where it's at</h2>
            <p>My life is in an exciting period of flux at the moment.  I have finally decided to move away from the damned service industry, and actually put this big, grey, mushy mass in my skull to some form of productive use. I started attending courses at <a href="https://www.codefellows.org/">Code Fellows</a> here in Seattle. So far I have learned the basics of web development with my interest and point of study being on javascript.  I have also learned HTML & CSS within the same courses. </p>
            <hr><h3>But Why?</h3><hr>
            <p>I have been needing some movement in my life for a while, and it finally is time.  I am getting <a href="https://www.theknot.com/us/james-bennett-and-tina-marissa-riopel-jan-2016">married</a> soon, and that cetainly is one of my reasons for the change.  I also feel that I need to have something to show for my work.  I love producing things; from being a baker to being a draftsperson, I have always loved having something to show for my work, and I've missed it.  Learning logic through javascript/ jQuery has opened a door to whole new world of creative possibilities. Even more fundamental to me than all that is that I want to do something that I can hang my hat on, to have a level of respect for myself through my work that service can't provide (at least, not for me). </p>
